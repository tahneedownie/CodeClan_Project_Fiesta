Festival App


Goal: Create a web application in Spark with Hibernate/Java back end
You have been asked to create a web app to allow the management of a Festival manage the artists and visitor tracking. (No expense spared)


MVP

The user must be able to add venues/stages, add / remove artists to venues (line-up), feed/water/pay artists. You should also be able to transfer artists between venues/stages.


Project Extensions
•	Artists marked as musicians can perform in the same venue but those marked as comedians can only be placed with artists of the same type.
•	Artists can randomly rampage and break out of their venues.
•	Visitors can enter / exit the festivals if the artists are not rampaging.
•	View the number of visitors checked into the festival at a given time.
•	Anything else you can dream up!
